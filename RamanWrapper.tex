I wanted to run the \texttt{diffractometry} peak-analysis code (which can be both time-consuming and prone to stray errors halting compilation) without the need to re-run the peak analysis every time the document is re-compiled.

For that purpose, I created this wrapper function.
Its job is to call \Rfun{Ramanpk()} only if necessary (i.e., peak analysis has not already been performed). That is made possible by saving the results of a successful analysis to a \texttt{raman-peak-data.rda} file in the directory of the report.
