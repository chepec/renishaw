## renishaw

An R package that imports ASCII-format Raman spectra files,
saves them to R dataframe along with a user-defined sampleid.

The package also contains functions to baseline and peak fit the spectra
using the `diffractometry` package, and a wrapper function to call them
and save the fitting results to disk.
