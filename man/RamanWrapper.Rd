\description{
I wanted to run the \pkg{diffractometry} peak-analysis code (which can be both
time-consuming and prone to stray errors halting compilation) without the need
to re-run the peak analysis every time the document is re-compiled.
For that purpose, I created this wrapper function.
Its job is to call \code{\link{Ramanpk}} only if necessary (i.e., peak analysis
has not already been performed). That is made possible by saving the results
of a successful analysis to a \code{raman-peak-data.rda} file in the directory
of the report.
Also includes an override option to force re-running of peak analysis.
